## Linear Regression

In a regression problem, the aim is to predict the output of a continous value, like a price or a probability. Contrast this with a classification problem, where the aim is to select a class from a list of classes(for example, where a picture contains an apple or an orange, recognizing which fruit is in the picture).

This project aims to build models to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. The classic Auto MPG data set was sourced from the archives of UCI.
