# Linear Regression

In a regression problem, the aim is to predict the output of a continous value, like a price or a probability. Contrast this with a classification problem, where the aim is to select a class from a list of classes(for example, where a picture contains an apple or an orange, recognizing which fruit is in the picture).

This project uses the classic Auto MPG dataset and demonstrates how to build models to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. To do this, you will provide the models with a description of many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.
